# Credit-Risk-Analysis
17.3.1
Fast lending a peer to peer lending services company wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk. Management believes that this will produce a quicker more reliable loan experience. Machine learning will lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to low default rates. Assist lead data scientist Jill in implementing this plan. Build numerous  machine learning models and algorithms to predict credit risk. Use techniques such as sampling and boosting to make the most of your models and data. Once designed and implemented, evaluate performance and see how well the models predict data.

Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once you’re done, you’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
