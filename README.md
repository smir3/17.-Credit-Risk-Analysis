# Credit-Risk-Analysis

## Background, Purpose and Task

Background and Purpose: 

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company. LendingClub management is seeking to improve the reliability and efficiency of their loan experience. Jill-the lead Data Scientist-would like to use machine learning to predict credit risk. Using machine learning will lead to a more accuracte identification of good candidates for loans, which will in turn lead to low default rates. 

Task:
I have been tasked with assisting Jill in implementing this plan. Using the credit care dataset from LendingClub, I will first oversample the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then undersample the data using the the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Next, I will use the SMOTEENN algorithm to implement a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling. I will then compare the BalancedRandomForestClassifier machine learning model with the EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk.

Once these analyses are complete, I will evaluate the performance of these models to conclude whether its advisable to use them for predicting credit risk. 

## Results
There were six machine learning models tested in this analysis.

1. Naive Random Oversampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Undersampling
4. Combinatation (Over and Under) Sampling
5. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
6. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
